## Massachusetts School Project

<img src="images/Massachusetts Education Project.png?raw=true"/>

In this project, I will be assuming the role of a new hire on the Massachusetts Department of Education data team. I've been asked with doing the following:
  - A report to show the school board the state of the school system 
  - How does class size affect college admission?
  - What are the top math schools in the state?
  - What schools are struggling he most?

This project is something that hits somewhat close to me since I also worked as an educator overseas. Therefore, I was quite curious in the contents of this dataset and the relationships between the columns that could possibly be discovered.

This time, I'll be using Tableau to work with our already cleaned dataset and will provide the answer the questions that I've been assigned to uncover. Stay tuned!

### Data Analysis

### 1. You can have sections and text.

Just like this. And you can even add internal coding blocks

```python
print('this is the python code I used to solve this problem')
```

### 2. You can add any images you'd like.
