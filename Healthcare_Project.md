# Healthcare Project

<img src="images/Massachusetts Education Project.png?raw=true"/>

In this project we are going to play the level of a newly hired health care data analyst at a hospital and because our supervisor is busy, they have given us a lot of tasks to do 

- What does the time spent in the hospital look like? Are the majority of our patients spending less than 7 days?
- Try to find out which medical specialties have the highest number of procedures on average.
- Are there any racial discrepancies? (based on the number of lab procdures done)
- Do patients who get a lot of procedures done stay longer in the hospital?
- We want to perform a medical test on any patient who is either African-American or had an "Up" value for metformin. Please help us compile a list of patients who   meet this criteria
- Find "success stories" where patients who came into thie hospital with an emergency (`admission_type_id` is 1), but stayed less than the average time in the hospital 
- We are asked to write a summary for the top 50 medical patients in a format like this: "Patient 2383 was Caucasian and was readmitted. They had 21 medications and 32 lab procedures."

This project will be more of a walkthrough than anything else and at least prove (hopefully)that I have basic SQL skills if my other SQL projects don't convey that too well.

## Why This Project and What the data set is?

The reason why I personally chose this dataset is because I have a keen interest in the financial sector and it is one of the domains that I have the most curiosity in working in. So I thought it would be a good exercise in getting my feet wet and get used to some of the columns and common terminology that I could possibly be seeing in financial datasets. Plus, I thought that this would be a pretty good bit of a SQL flex as I spend most of my time in Python, I just thought that a little bit of a SQL wouldn't hurt! üí™üí™üí™

Lastly, who doesn't like learning about finances??

For this dataset, we are using data from the archives of [the World Bank website](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home). In case you haven't heard of the World Bank before, they are an international financial institution that provides grants and loans to developing countries with the goal of creating sustainable development projects that will lead to more economic opportunities and the easing of poverty in said countries. 

The actual [dataset](https://finances.worldbank.org/Loans-and-Credits/IDA-Statement-Of-Credits-and-Grants-Historical-Dat/tdwh-3krx), IDA Statement Of Credits and Grants - Historical Data, is curated from the World Bank's International Development Association or IDA for short. The IDA is a department of the World Bank that is responsible for helping the world's poorest countries and provides low-interest to zero loans called "credits" along with grants to help fund projects that reduce inequalities and help improve living conditions. It also has a whopping 1.12 Million rows, so it gives us a sense of how large of a scale that the IDA is operating on.

The [dataset](https://finances.worldbank.org/Loans-and-Credits/IDA-Statement-Of-Credits-and-Grants-Historical-Dat/tdwh-3krx) contains historical snapshots including the most recent snapshots of the dataset.

### Data Dictionary

There are 30 columns of data, but I will only go over the relevant ones that'll be most crucial to our data analysis for this project:
- Borrower: The representative of the borrower to which the Bank loan is made.
- Country: Country to which loan has been issued. Loans to the IFC are included under the country ‚ÄúWorld‚Äù.
- Service Charge Rate: Current Interest rate or service charge applied to loan.
- Due to IDA: Amount currently owed to the IDA

## Data Analysis

### What does the time spent in the hospital look like? Are the majority of our patients spending less than 7 days?

To start out, first we're going to create a histogram! This might sound odd to see that because SQL isn't necessarily renowned for its visualization capabilities, but there is a query we can use to produce a histogram.

<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/query1.png?raw=true"/>

We use this query to output the histogram. Note that we are using `timespent` column as we're trying to determine whether the majority of our patients are spending less than 7 days in the hospital. Knowing that our patients are spending less than 7 days in the hospital can free up beds faster in the even of overcrowding and also save some money for both us and the patient! Let's print our histogram now.

<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/histogram.png?raw=true"/>

As we can see by the results, the majority of our patients do indeed spend less than 7 days in our hospital beds!

### Try to find out which medical specialties have the highest number of procedures on average.

Now with this line of code we're going to check out the distinct values (or fields) in the `medical_specialty` column using the following query.
<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/query2.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/output1.png?raw=true"/>

I also counted the unique values in the `medical_specialty` column and it turns out that we have 73 distinct values.

Now that we know what those are, let's create a query that groups all the values of `medical_specialty` together and find the average `num_procedures` per specialty. We also want to count how many patients there are per specialty (please note that one row in this dataset represents one patient).

<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/query3.png?raw=true"/>

And here are a few lines of the output

<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/output2.png?raw=true"/>

Not only does it look more organized now, but we are closer to our next goal of answering which specialties have the highest number of procedures on average. So let's say that our supervisor instructs us to filter down to specialties that have at least 50 patients and an average of at least 2.5 procedures per patient for a given specialty. With this we should have a great idea on what specialties to focus on! 

So let's put this concept in to a query and see what we get.

<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/query4.1.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/output3.png?raw=true"/>

Just as planned! We now have 5 specialites that were able to meet our rigorous criteria and as wek can see from both the `avg_procedures` and `rows_count` columns, a lot of patients are treated in these specialites and they get at least 2.5 procedures too. These are amazing results and I'm quite sure that the supervisor will be delighted with these results!

### Are there any racial discrepancies? (based on the number of lab procdures done)

Next, our supervisor has asked us to check to see if there any discrepancies in treatment based on race. For this purpose, we will use the `num_lab_procedures` that patients from all racial backgrounds are receiving the highest quality treatment. The table that we have been using until now, `patient`, doesn't have any information that outlines a person's racial background. Therefore, we will use another table called `demographics` employ the SQL inner join technique along the shared `patient_nbr` column to ensure that we can properly align the demographic info of the new table to the parent table. The `patient_nbr` column is our primary key for both tables, so we know that the values present are all unique.  

<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/query5.png?raw=true"/>

For this query, we created a CTE and used it in a view to use for future reference and set up our join and the columns to be displayed from said join. Next we want to take that view and create a query that categorizes our database by race and use the take the average of `num_lab_procedures`and we can determine whether all of our patients are getting equal treatment.

Here is the query:

<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/query6.png?raw=true"/>

And the output:

<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/output4.png?raw=true"/>

From these results, we can determine that there aren't any outliers that would indicate the presence of preferential treatment due to racial makeup. Now let's move further in our analysis.

### Do patients who get a lot of procedures done stay longer in the hospital?

Next we were asked to see if patients that have a lot of procedures done tend to have longer stay times in the hospital. First, we run a query that gives a sense of the data distribution for the `num_lab_procedures` column.

<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/query7.png?raw=true"/>


<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/output5.png?raw=true"/>

From the output, we can see that `num_lab_procedures` has an average value of around 43 procedures. With this knowledge, we can use a series of `CASE` statements to categorize our patients based on their `num_lab_procedures` value. If a value for `num_lab_procedures` falls within 0-24 it will be assigned the tag of "few", for 25-54: "average", for over 55: "many".

Now we are going to create a query that creates these tags for every patient, groups all of them by these tags and looks at the average hospital stay per group. Now, let's look at that query and its output together

<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/query7.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/output6.png?raw=true"/>

From what we have seen, we can now draw a positive correlation between time spent in the hospital and how many procedures that they have. The longer a patient stays at a hospital the more procedures they have and the shorter their stay, the fewer procedures they have.

### We want to perform a medical test on any patient who is either African-American or had an "Up" value for metformin. Please help us compile a list of patients who   meet this criteria

Next, I've been tasked to compile a list of patients who are either African-American or have a value of "Up" for the `metformin` column. Here is a simple query that we can use, making use of the `UNION` function. Some lines of the output will also be displayed.

<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/query8.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/output7.png?raw=true"/>

### Find "success stories" where patients who came into thie hospital with an emergency (`admission_type_id` is 1), but stayed less than the average time in the hospital 

To find these success stories, we have to have something in our query like this: `WHERE time_in_hospital < AVG(time_in_hospital)`. But actually, this wouldn't work and it would produce an error because we can't use `AVG` in a `WHERE` clause, only in a `SELECT` clause. So we have to use a subquery to work around this. Here is an example of how we can get what we want:

<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/query10.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/output10.png?raw=true"/>

Subqueries are a useful tool, but they can make things look messy if we have a lot of them to manage. Therefore, we can once again use a CTE to make things more neat. Last time we used created a `VIEW`, so this time we're going to use `WITH`. We'll update the query and confirm that the output is still the same as our previous query.

<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/query10.1.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/output11.png?raw=true"/>

With the help of the `WITH` CTE our subquery has now been condensed from `(SELECT AVG(time_in_hospital) FROM health)` to just `(SELECT * FROM avg_time)`. 

And we also have a nice list of "success story" patients to provide to our supervisor too!

---
Next we've been asked to generate a query that will summarize the results of the top 50 medicated patients along with the number of lab procedures that they had(table will be ordered by `num_medications`and afterwards `num_lab_procedures`). The output of our queries should produce values in this format: 

### We are asked to write a summary for the top 50 medical patients in a format like this: "Patient 2383 was Caucasian and was readmitted. They had 21 medications and 32 lab procedures."

Using a combination of `CONCAT` and `CASE`, we will be able to generate multiple summaries like this. Here is the query and the output below:

<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/query11.png?raw=true"/>
<img src="images/SQL Healthcare Project/output9.png?raw=true"/>

## Recap/Conclusion

As I specified in the beginning of this project, this was meant to be more of a walkthrough of basic SQL fundamentals than a super in-depth project. But in answering these questions:

- Return all rows of the table, but only the borrower & due to IDA column
- Only show the first 5 rows of the previous query 
- Abbreviate one of the column names so it's easier to write 
- Show us all transactions from Nicaragua (the country)?
- How many total transactions? 
- How many total transactions per country?? 
- What is the max owed to the IDA?
- What is the average service charge rate for a loan?
- Return all loans from the country of Honduras where the service charge rate is larger than 1 
- Who has the most loans?

I feel like we've seen that SQL is more than capable of answering questions like these and even more complex questions, we definitely could. We would be able to do such things as group our information into the `region` column, answer questions such as which region has the most transactions/loans and use those findings to explore even more insights! In the future if I were to revisit this dataset, I would combine it with Python for getting rid of the nulls and dropping some rows (transactions) with a lot of null columns as I don't think we lose too much, by dropping them
