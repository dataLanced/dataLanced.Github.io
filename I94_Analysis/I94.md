# Finding Indicators of Heavy Traffic on I-94

![image](https://i.imgur.com/tEHb8ZB.png)

In this project, our goal is to determine the possible factors of heavy traffic on the I-94 highway. We will be looking at things like the weather type, time of the day, time of the week, time of the year, etc.

The source of our dataset can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume)—made available by John Hogue. It tracks the traffic volume of westbound traffic on I-94 from 2012-2018 and you can find the data dictionary at the source above underneath the "Attribute Information".

```python
# Load the dataset
traffic_94 = pd.read_csv('Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv')
```

Now we're going to isolate the values based on the time of the day


```python
# Changing date_time column into datetime dtype
traffic_94['date_time'] = pd.to_datetime(traffic_94['date_time'])

# Make a copy of our dataset
Day = traffic_94.copy()[(traffic_94['date_time'].dt.hour >= 7) & (traffic_94['date_time'].dt.hour < 19)]
Night = traffic_94.copy()[(traffic_94['date_time'].dt.hour < 7) | (traffic_94['date_time'].dt.hour >= 19)]

print(Day.shape)
print(Night.shape)
```

    (23877, 9)
    (24327, 9)


In the last cell, I did several tasks. First, I converted the `date_time` column into a `datetime` dtype, so we could make it easier to make `dt`-based transformations. Next, we made a copy of our `traffic_94` dataset created two boolean filtered dataframes that cover two distinct 12-hour periods:
 * 7 AM to 7 PM (Daytime)
 * 7 PM to 7 AM (Nightime)
 
According to our work, there are 24327 instances of `Night` and 23877 instances of `Day`


```python
def day_or_night(time):
    # traffic_94['time_of_day'] = traffic_94['date_time'].dt.hour
    
    if time >= 7 and time < 19:
         return 'Day'
    else:
        return 'Night'

traffic_94['time_of_day'] = traffic_94['date_time'].dt.hour.apply(day_or_night)
 
traffic_94['time_of_day'].value_counts()
```




    Night    24327
    Day      23877
    Name: time_of_day, dtype: int64



This is very similar to the filtered dataframe method. Only this time, I decided to make a function to transform our data element-wise using the apply() function. I created the day_or_night function to create a categorical column that designates a row as being Day or Night based on the value that it interacts with our date_time column after we convert into a 24 hour format using Series.dt.hour. These values will be placed in a new column called time_of_day.

After creating the new column, we then count how many instances of Night and Day are in time_of_day. I determined that there were 24327 instances of Night and 23877 instances of Day, just like in our other method.

Next, I want to find out why there is such a large discrepancy between the counts for Day vs. Night. Let's see an example of that that in the next cell.


```python
traffic_94.iloc[205:207]
```

I perused the dataset looking specifically at the `date_time` for irregularities and I found that although the traffic volume is supposed to be checked at 1 hour interval, many of those intervals were skipped and that's what resulted in the discrepancies between `Day` and `Night`

Looking at the few cells above, it can be determined that the indicators of heavy traffic are overwhelmingly more prevalent at night than during the day. The `Day` graph has a left skew and the `Night` graph has a right skew. Because of I've determined that `Day` has a more substantial impact on traffic volume and the questions that we'd like to answer, I will focus solely on our daytime data. We will store the filtered dataframe we indexed for `Day` values earlier and store it in a separate dataframe: `day = traffic_94.copy()[traffic_94['time_of_day'] == 'Day']`


```python
day = traffic_94.copy()[traffic_94['time_of_day'] == 'Day']
```


```python
day['month'] = day['date_time'].dt.month
by_month = day.groupby('month').mean()
by_month['traffic_volume']
```

plt.ylabel('Average traffic volume')

Looking at our data here, I can see that there is an interesting dip in July for some reason. This goes against the expected trend that we would expect for the summer months.


```python
day['year'] = day['date_time'].dt.year
only_july = day[day['month'] == 7]
only_july.groupby('year').mean()['traffic_volume'].plot.line()
plt.show()
```


    
![png](output_24_0.png)
    


We investigated July further to see what was the cause of the dip in traffic volume by looking at `July` for other years. And we see that July 2016 accounted for the unusual dip when looking at our average volume per month graph a few cells above. And we can confidently say this because the other years mostly fell in line with the other summer months.

So I searched "july 2016 i94 minnesota" on Google and [this article](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2016/07/22/i94-stpaul-shutdown-twin-cities-weekend-road-woes) came up. The article indicated that I-94 was shutdown for at least a part of the month and this seems to explain why the traffic volume was so low for July 2016 in particular.

Next, let's check out the traffic volume according to the day of the week


```python
day['dayofweek'] = day['date_time'].dt.dayofweek
by_dayofweek = day.groupby('dayofweek').mean()
by_dayofweek['traffic_volume']
```




    dayofweek
    0    4893.551286
    1    5189.004782
    2    5284.454282
    3    5311.303730
    4    5291.600829
    5    3927.249558
    6    3436.541789
    Name: traffic_volume, dtype: float64




```python
by_dayofweek['traffic_volume'].plot.line()
plt.ylabel('Average traffic volume')
plt.show()
```

As we can see in our graph, there is a huge difference in traffic between the weekdays (values 0-4) and the weekends (values 5-6).


```python
day['hour'] = day['date_time'].dt.hour
weekdays = day.copy()[day['dayofweek'] <= 4]
weekends = day.copy()[day['dayofweek'] > 4]
by_hour_weekdays = weekdays.groupby('hour').mean()
by_hour_weekends = weekends.groupby('hour').mean()

print(by_hour_weekdays['traffic_volume'])
print(by_hour_weekends['traffic_volume'])
```

So for our `Weekday Traffic` graph, traffic volume is maxed out at 7 AM and around 4-5 PM. For `Weekend Traffic` the traffic volume peaks at 12 PM and stays relatively for flat the rest of the night.


```python
weather_indicators = ['temp','rain_1h', 'snow_1h', 'clouds_all', 'weather_main', 'weather_description']
day.corr()['traffic_volume']
```




    temp              0.128317
    rain_1h           0.003697
    snow_1h           0.001265
    clouds_all       -0.032932
    traffic_volume    1.000000
    month            -0.022337
    year             -0.003557
    dayofweek        -0.416453
    hour              0.172704
    Name: traffic_volume, dtype: float64




```python
plt.scatter(day['temp'], day['traffic_volume'])
plt.xlim(220, 320)
plt.show()
```

Based on what I've seen here, this graph and none of the other columns seem to be reliable indicatiors of heavy traffic at all.


```python
weather_main = day.groupby('weather_main').mean()
weather_description = day.groupby('weather_description').mean()
```

Above, we grouped the data by `weather_main` and `weather_description` and used `mean()` to aggregate the data.


```python
weather_main['traffic_volume'].plot.barh()
plt.title('Weather effect on traffic volume')
plt.show()
```

Looking at our graph, we can see that "Clouds" as the highest value, followed by "Drizzle", "Rain", and "Clear. But I don't think that this graph really tells us anything about how weather type influences heavy traffic.


```python
weather_description['traffic_volume'].plot.barh(figsize=(12, 16))
plt.title('Weather effect on traffic volume expanded')
plt.show()

```

For this graph there are 3 instances in where for average `weather_description` that exceed 5000 cars These are:
    * shower snow
    * light rain and snow
    * proximity thunderstorm with drizzle

Surprisingly, this is not what I personally expected because you'd expect most people to not want to take the road when this type of weather occurs. But in this case, the three types of weather above aren't truly inclement weather compared to other types. I think that these 3 particular types of weather might be the tipping point that jostles people who prefer to walk or ride a bicycle into taking a car instead.

In conclusion, I can determine that heavy traffic is influenced by the following:
   * Daytime (as opposed to night)
   * Weekdays (as opposed to weekends)
   * Rush hour times (7 AM and 4PM on weekdays)
   * Summer months (as opposed to winter months)
   * Three specific weather types:
        * shower snow
        * light rain and snow
        * proximity thunderstorm with drizzle
        
These factors, according to my insights, are the most culpable for the heavier traffic volumes on I-94.
  
I will continue to periodically come back to this dataset to reiterate and update with more insights, cleaning up and finding newer more efficient ways to expedite old processes! Thank you for your time!
